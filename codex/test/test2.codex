While I pondered, weak and weary
Twas brillig and high slithy toes
Did Gyren Gimble in the wabe
Thus mimsey were his borogroves
There once was a dinosaur named Fred
He was thought to be dead
He used to eat flowers
But now he devours
All humans instead",

Biblo knew him as Pirinine Brook
Hobbits danced around with glee
As Pirinine Took fell and broke his knee.
