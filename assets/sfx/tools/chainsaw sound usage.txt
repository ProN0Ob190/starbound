IDEAL SOUND USAGE FOR CHAINSAW
====================================

While idle in player's hands, loop chainsaw_idle.wav.
Upon player use on tree first play chainsaw_rev_up.wav 
and then start loop of either chainsaw_cut_wood for normal trees
or chainsaw_cut_metal for the rare metal tree. These sounds are 
to loop either until the player lets go of the mouse button
or until the cut is complete. Once this happens, 
end any chainsaw_cut sounds that are playing, 
then play chainsaw_rev_down.wav before resuming loop of chainsaw_idle.wav.
 
For an example of how this should sound in game, listen to chainsaw_demo.wav. 
The first playthrough will show how it should be once it's all working, 
including a sample of the cutting sound looping at least partially.
In the second playthrough there will be gaps between the samples so you can hear where the files are separated.
