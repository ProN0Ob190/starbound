    "Gather round, and let us speak of Dreadwing the pirate. This vile bird once posed as a Glitch king, went toe to toe with a Floran, outwrestled an Apex, outflew an Avian, outdrank a human, and outpatronised a Hylotl.",

    "He's the self-confessed scourge of the galaxy, and cannot wait for the day when the rest of the universe notices. His latest plan is as fiendish as it is simple. Distress beacons.",

    "Curious explorers and pesky do-gooders can't resist the call for help. Then, as soon as they make contact, he's there, in one of his many custom UFOs, an army of angry penguins in tow.",

    "Nobody really knows what Dreadwing gains from these attacks. Analysts estimate that the destruction of UFOs must be costing Dreadwing hundreds of thousands of pixels. And yet, he persists, smashing his way through settlements and blowing up camps until eventually he's chased off, tail-feathers between his legs.",

    "Fun Dreadwing fact: Dreadwing's early UFO design did not allow him to destroy terrain, thus leaving him vulnerable to adventurers who hid themselves below ground."
