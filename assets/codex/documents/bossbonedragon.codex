    "Dragons aren't real. That's the story told across all species. Even the Florans, the hunters of great prey, dismiss the idea of dragons as mere folly. Possibly because if they encounter one, they're too busy killing it to notice what it is.",

    "But dragons were real, once, at least if this reanimated bonedragon is to be believed. Lay down the right bait and the creature swoops in from the skies, scorching all in its path. Mindless, murderous, and completely lacking in flesh, it's a sight to behold.",

    "Where does it come from? Nobody knows. Even Greenfinger of the Floran is stumped. Perhaps it is the work of those strange, winged demons sighted on distant planets. Or maybe the unusual Agarans, the mushroom people who till the earth?",

    "Or perhaps it is the work of those mysterious, hooded figures adventurers have spoken of. Those cultists, who claim to possess a dark, necromantic magic, and whose hidden master has yet to play their hand...",

    "Fun Bone Dragon Fact: The only person to successfully tame a bonedragon is Hiraki Corale, who grew bored and released the creature minutes later. When asked, she claimed she had forgotten how she befriended the beast."
